## Hashtopia

**Hashtopia is a knowledge base for password security.**  
It focuses on cryptographic hashes, password analysis, attack methodology, and the tools and data used to understand how real-world passwords fail and how they can be better protected.

This site brings together **concepts, research, analysis techniques, and tooling** used by security professionals, students, and researchers working in offensive and defensive security, auditing, and education. The goal is not exploitation, but **visibility**: understanding how passwords behave in practice so systems can be designed and secured more effectively.

Whether you are learning the fundamentals of cryptographic hashing, analyzing password entropy and reuse, or exploring how attackers and defenders evaluate password strength, Hashtopia is intended to serve as a **reference and learning resource**.

With the latest content update, you may notice that there are more references to **attack paths** and related subjects appearing through out the site. This is a deliberate change that will be slowly integrated across the entire body of knowledge. SpecterOps, the creators of BloodHound, have been producing interesting research and tooling as they demystify the Identity Attack path problem. Since passwords are used in many access schemes, we can use the BloodHound Graph to visualize how credentialed access functions in organizations and really develop an understanding of how far reaching a particular password or hash can go in the world.
