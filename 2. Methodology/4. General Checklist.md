Use this checklist **before, during, and after** any analysis effort and in conjunction with the [[3. General Methodology]]

---

## 1. Authorization and Scope

☐ Explicit authorization exists to analyze the data or system  
☐ Purpose of the analysis is clearly defined (education, research, audit)  
☐ Dataset or system boundaries are documented  
☐ Legal, ethical, and organizational constraints are understood  

---

## 2. Objective Definition

☐ Primary objective is clearly documented  
☐ Success metrics are defined in advance  
☐ Assumptions are explicitly stated  
☐ Known limitations are acknowledged  
☐ Analysis focuses on **measurement and understanding**, not extraction  

---

## 3. Data and Input Validation

☐ Hash formats and algorithms are correctly identified  
☐ Salts, iterations, and key-stretching parameters are documented  
☐ Password datasets (if applicable) are legally obtained  
☐ Data is normalized and cleaned consistently  
☐ Duplicate handling strategy is defined  
☐ Raw data is preserved separately from derived or processed results  

---

## 4. Environment and Tooling Control

☐ Tool names and versions are recorded  
☐ Configurations and parameters are saved  
☐ Execution environment is isolated from production systems  
☐ Resource constraints (CPU, GPU, memory, time) are understood  
☐ Any hardware acceleration in use is documented  

---

## 5. Execution Discipline

☐ Parameters are not changed mid-run without documentation  
☐ Commands, scripts, or workflows are logged  
☐ Runtime and resource usage are tracked  
☐ Errors, anomalies, or unexpected behavior are noted  

> Consistency matters more than speed. Analytical power without discipline produces constisent sub-optimal results on a protracted timeline.

---

## 6. Result Validation and Interpretation

☐ Results align with the original objectives  
☐ Metrics are interpreted in proper context  
☐ Patterns, trends, and anomalies are examined  
☐ Edge cases and outliers are investigated  
☐ Conclusions do not exceed tested conditions  

---

## 7. Ethical Handling of Results

☐ Raw passwords or credentials are **not** published  
☐ Identifiable data is anonymized, aggregated, or sanitized 
☐ Sensitive implementation details are omitted when sharing externally  

---

## 8. Documentation and Archival

☐ Objectives, inputs, and assumptions are recorded  
☐ Tool versions and configurations are documented  
☐ Raw and processed results are archived securely  
☐ Observations and limitations are captured  
☐ Conclusions and recommendations are summarized clearly  

> Undocumented work has little to no value outside of its immediate use.

---

## 9. Review and Reassessment

☐ Critical steps are re-run to confirm consistency  
☐ Findings are compared with prior analysis or research  
☐ Conclusions are reassessed as new data becomes available  
☐ Documentation is updated when assumptions or scope change

## How to Use This Checklist

This checklist is intentionally **tool-agnostic** and **context-independent**.

Use it to:
- Validate your own analysis
- Review the work of others
- Ensure consistency across experiments
- Support reproducible, defensible conclusions
