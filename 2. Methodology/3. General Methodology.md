This section describes the **general methodology** used throughout Hashtopia for password and cryptographic hash analysis. It outlines the guiding principles, workflows, and verification steps that underpin all research, tools, and datasets referenced on this site.

The goal of this methodology is to promote **clarity, reproducibility, and responsible use** while studying real-world password behavior and authentication risk.

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Clarity over complexity**  
  Analysis should be understandable and transparent. Steps, assumptions, and results when clearly documented provide substantial gains over the course of both cracking and analysis.

- **Ethical and responsible usage**  
  Techniques and tools described on Hashtopia must only be used on systems or datasets where explicit authorization exists. Unauthorized or malicious use is out of scope.

- **Reproducibility**  
  Results should be reproducible by others. This includes documenting hash types, tool versions, wordlists, parameters, environments, and timeframes when applicable. The overall intent is that you are preserving the work that you do in order for it to be built on or utilized in the future.

- **Defensive mindset**  
  The purpose of analyzing password and hash weaknesses is to improve security controls, authentication design, and user protections, not to facilitate exploitation. Any instance or reference of exploitation discussed within this body of knowledge is done so in the context of offensive security research.

- **Empirical grounding**  
  Conclusions should be based on observed data and repeatable analysis, not assumptions or anecdotal evidence. Conclusions should be grounded in your data, sanitized appropriately, and shared responsibly.

## Typical Workflow

Although specific workflows vary depending on the task, most password and hash analysis follows this general sequence:

### 1. Define objectives and scope

Before any analysis begins, clearly establish:
- The purpose of the analysis (research, audit, education, validation)
- The dataset or hashes being examined
- Authorization and usage constraints
- The metrics or outcomes you want to measure

---

### 2. Identify and prepare inputs

- Confirm the hash algorithm(s) in use
- Identify salts, iterations, or key-stretching parameters
- Normalize and clean datasets (remove duplicates, ensure consistent formatting)
- Separate raw data from working copies


---

### 3. Select an analysis path

Choose the appropriate approach based on objectives:

- **[[PACK - Extended User Guide Addendum|Password Analysis Methodology]]**  
  Statistical analysis, pattern detection, entropy evaluation, reuse measurement. Password analysis focuses the 'how does a user arrive at this string?'

- **[[Concept Application - HashCat|Hash-cracking experimentation]]**  
  Controlled experiments using authorized hashes, wordlists, and rules to measure resistance and behavior. Hash cracking is primarily focused on defeating a cryptographic implementation.

---

### 4. Execute analysis or experiments

- Use well-understood tools and documented configurations
- Track runtime, resource usage, and error conditions
- Maintain logs of commands, parameters, and versions
- Avoid mixing datasets or changing parameters mid-experiment without documentation

Discipline and control are essential if you aim to build an efficient process. Some of the aforementioned bullets may seem tedious, but I urge you to capture this data and review your method of execution, it will lead to substantial improvement of your process over time.

---

### 5. Aggregate and interpret results

- Analyze outcomes for patterns, trends, and anomalies
- Measure success rates, entropy distributions, or failure modes
- Compare results across hash types, configurations, or datasets
- Validate conclusions by re-running or cross-checking where possible

Avoid over-generalizing results beyond their tested scope. In many cases there is great value in exposing flaws in a cryptographic implementation but that value will diminish if there is no repeatability or validation.

---

### 6. Draw security-relevant conclusions

Translate findings into defensible insights, such as:
- Common password construction patterns
- The impact of hash algorithm choice on resistance
- How salts, iterations, or policies change outcomes
- Where authentication design fails under real use

---

### 7. Document and archive

Good analysis is useless without documentation.

Record:
- Dataset sources and constraints
- Tool versions and configurations
- Raw and processed results
- Observations and limitations

This supports repeatability, review, and future research.

## General workflow

Use this table to validate analysis at each stage:

| Phase         | Items to Verify                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Preparation   | Authorization confirmed, scope defined, hash type identified |
| Data Handling | Dataset cleaned, normalized, duplicates handled              |
| Tooling       | Tool versions verified, configurations documented            |
| Execution     | Logs captured, parameters recorded, errors monitored         |
| Analysis      | Metrics defined, results validated, assumptions stated       |
| Documentation | Results archived, conclusions contextualized                 |

---

## Best Practices and Ethics

- Only analyze data or systems you own or are explicitly authorized to test
- Never publish raw cracked credentials or personally identifiable data
- Anonymize or aggregate results when sharing findings
- Provide context so results are not misinterpreted
- Follow responsible disclosure practices when vulnerabilities are discovered

Hashtopia exists to **reduce risk**, not to enable harm.
