**BRUTE-FORCE-ATTACK** - the act of trying every possible combination of a given  
keyspace or character set for a given length  
**DICTIONARY** - a collection of commons words, phrases, keyboard patterns,  
generated passwords, or leaked passwords, also known as a wordlist  
**DICTIONARY-ATTACK** - using a file containing common or known password  
combinations or words in an attempt to match a given hashing function's output  
by running said words through the same target hashing function  
**HASH** - the fixed bit result of a hash function  
**HASH-FUNCTION** - maps data of arbitrary size to a bit string of a fixed size (a  
hash function) which is designed to also be a one-way function, that is, a  
function which is infeasible to invert  
**ITERATIONS** - the number of times an algorithm is run over a given hash  
**KEYSPACE** - the number of possible combinations for a given character set to the  
power of it's length (i.e. charsetAlength)  
**MASK-ATTACK** - using placeholder representations to try all combinations of a  
given keyspace, similar to brute-force but more targeted and efficient  
**PASSWORD-ENTROPY** - an estimation of how difficult a password will be to crack  
given its character set and length  
**PLAINTEXT** - unaltered text that hasn't been obscured or algorithmically altered  
through a hashing function  
**RAKING** - generating random password rules/candidates in an attempt to discover a  
previously unknown matching password pattern  
**RAINBOW TABLE** - a precomputed table of a targeted cryptographic hash function of  
a certain minimum and maximum character length  
**RULE** ATTACK - similar to a programming language for generating candidate  
passwords based on some input such as a dictionary  
**SALT** - random data that used as additional input to a one-way function  
**WORDLIST** - a collection of commons words, phrases, keyboard patterns, generated  
passwords, or leaked passwords, also known as a dictionary
**SALT** = random data that's used as additional input to a one-way function  
**ITERATIONS** = the number of times an algorithm is run over a given hash  
**DICTIONARY/WORDLIST ATTACK** = straight attack uses a precompiled list of words,  
phrases, and common/unique strings to attempt to match a password.  
**BRUTE-FORCE-ATTACK** attempts every possible combination of a given character  
set, usually up to a certain length.  
**RULE-ATTACK** = generates permutations against a given wordlist by modifying,  
trimming, extending, expanding, combining, or skipping words.  
**MASK-ATTACK**= a form of targeted brute-force attack by using placeholders for  
characters in certain positions (i.e. ?a?a?a?l?d?d).  
**HYBRID-ATTACK** = combines a Dictionary and Mask Attack by taking input from the  
dictionary and adding mask placeholders (i.e. dict.txt ?d?d?d).  
**CRACKING-RIG**= from a basic laptop to a 64 GPU cluster, this is the  
hardware/platform on which you perform your password hash attacks.
